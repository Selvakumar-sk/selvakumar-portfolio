      <p>The RAT project explores using ε-greedy reinforcement learning to enhance web application firewall (WAF) evasion. By tokenizing payloads using n-gram methods and clustering them, the system adapts in real-time to find new ways to bypass security rules.</p>

      <p>Traditional bypass methods are often static and can be mitigated quickly. RAT stands out by dynamically adapting to feedback from WAF responses. Each payload interaction gives a reward signal, training the model to prefer high-evasion clusters.</p>

      <p>This approach significantly increases bypass detection accuracy while reducing time spent testing ineffective payloads. The project showed success against both open-source and commercial WAF solutions during internal lab testing.</p>

      <p>Learnings from this project can help automate red team assessments, fuzzing payload generation, and contribute to research on secure AI in cybersecurity tools.</p>
