    <article>
      <p>API security is a cornerstone of modern application defense. During red-team engagements, I use a structured approach to uncover potential vulnerabilities in RESTful services.</p>

      <p>My process begins with endpoint enumeration and documentation analysis (Swagger/OpenAPI). I then apply fuzzing tools and custom scripts to test for injection points, broken object-level authorization (BOLA), and improper rate-limiting.</p>

      <p>I incorporate OWASP API Top 10 practices to identify misconfigurations. Automation is done via Burp Suite extensions and Postman scripts, paired with manual verification of sensitive endpoints like user update/delete.</p>

      <p>Learnings are fed back into the SDLC pipeline using security unit tests and developer briefings. This proactive cycle ensures long-term resilience and educates teams on common API risks.</p>
